"""
PyTorch Lightning callbacks for prod-9 MaskGiT training pipeline.

This module is intentionally kept minimal - all callback functionality
is now handled by PyTorch Lightning's built-in callbacks (ModelCheckpoint, etc.)
and within the Lightning modules themselves.

# No custom callbacks needed - using standard PyTorch Lightning callbacks
